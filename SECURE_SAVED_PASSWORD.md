If you don't want to re-enter passwords everytime connect to a saved scheme/mount URI (SMB, FTP, etc), you can use `Keyring` + `secret-tool` or `pass` + `GPG` or `passage` + `age` to store passwords. `Keyring` can only be use in GUI session, `GPG` and `passage` can use in both Headless and GUI session.

## Method 1. Use `secret-tool` with `Keyring` (Gnome Keyring or KWallet).

Best for GUI users.  
If you need to use headless workaround (see [HEADLESS_WORKAROUND.md](./HEADLESS_WORKAROUND.md)), you can only use [Method 2. Use `pass` (Password Store) with `GPG` encryption subkey](#method-2-use-pass-password-store-with-gpg-encryption-subkey).

- Install `secret-tool`:

  ```sh
  # Ubuntu
  sudo apt install libsecret-tools

  # Fedora
  sudo dnf install libsecret

  # Arch
  sudo pacman -S libsecret
  ```

- Install `GNOME-Keyring` (or KWallet):

  ```sh
  # Ubuntu
  sudo apt install gnome-keyring
  # Ubuntu GNOME already starts the keyring daemon automatically.
  # If you're using other DE or window manager, see manual startup notes below.

  # Fedora
  sudo dnf install gnome-keyring
  # Fedora Workstation (GNOME) starts the daemon automatically.
  # If you're using other DE or window manager, see manual startup notes below.

  # Arch
  sudo pacman -S gnome-keyring
  sudo systemctl enable --now --user gnome-keyring-daemon
  ```

  For other distros please ask gemini/chatgpt.

- Manual Startup `gnome-keyring` if need:
  Check if it's running: `pgrep -fl gnome-keyring-daemon`. Skip this step if it's already running.  
  If you're using i3, Xfce, sway, hyprland or other WM/DE [Read this](<https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME/Keyring#Using_gnome-keyring-daemon_outside_desktop_environments_(KDE,_GNOME,_XFCE,_...)>)
  Add this to your session startup (e.g., .xinitrc, ~/.xprofile, or your WM/DE’s autostart system):

  ```sh
  # Start gnome-keyring
  eval $(gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=pkcs11,secrets,ssh)
  ```

  Or copy `~/.config/yazi/plugins/gvfs.yazi/assets/gnome-keyring-daemon.service` to `~/.config/systemd/user/` and run:

  ```bash
  systemctl --user daemon-reload
  systemctl --user enable --now gnome-keyring-daemon.service
  ```

- Add `password_vault = "keyring"` to setup function in `~/.config/yazi/init.lua`:

  ```lua
  require("gvfs"):setup({
  password_vault = "keyring",
  })
  ```

Now you can use gvfs.yazi and save passwords to the keyring.  
You only need to unlock the keyring once after login or after trigger gvfs.yazi plugin.

- You can also auto unlock the keyring with PAM:
  - [Gnome Keyring Auto Unlock on login](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME/Keyring#Using_the_keyring)
  - [Kwallet Auto Unlock on login](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/KDE_Wallet#Unlock_KDE_Wallet_automatically_on_login)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to clear saved passwords, you can run these commands in terminal:

```bash
secret-tool search --all --unlock gvfs 1
secret-tool clear gvfs 1
```

## Method 2. Use `pass` (Password Store) with `GPG` encryption subkey

The only option for headless users.  
Can use on both GUI and headless session (non-active console, Like connect to a computer via SSH, etc).

- Install `pass` and `gpg`

  ```bash
  # Ubuntu
  sudo apt install pass gnupg

  # Fedora (Not tested, please report if it works)
  sudo dnf install pass gnupg2

  # Arch
  sudo pacman -S pass gnupg
  ```

  For other distros please ask gemini/chatgpt.

- Create a GPG key for encryption (Ignore if you already have a GPG key)

  ```bash
  gpg --full-generate-key
  ```

- Select `ECC (sign and encrypt)` and then select `Curve 25519` and `0 = key does not expire`. Usually you only need to press enter 3 times.  
  Then press `y` and `enter` to confirm. Enter name, email, comment, and passphrase.  
  Remember the passphrase, which will be used for unlocking the key.  
  Empty passphrase is also support but discouraged.

- Get the `<KEY_ID>` and `KEY_GRIP` of created GPG key:

  ```bash
  gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG --with-keygrip
  ```

  Result should look like this:

  ```bash
  sec   ed25519/xxxxxxxxxxxxx 2025-06-02 [SC]
        yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
        Keygrip = AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
  uid                 [ultimate] test <test@example.com>
  ssb   cv25519/zzzzzzzzzzzzz 2025-06-02 [E]
        Keygrip = BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
  ```

  Subkey for encryption is the one ends with `[E]`  
  => `<KEY_ID>` is `zzzzzzzzzzzzz` and `<KEY_GRIP>` is `BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB`  
  There can be multiple subkeys, but we only need one.

- Initialize the password store:

  ```bash
  # Re-run this with new <KEY_ID>, saved passwords will auto transfer to new one.
  pass init <KEY_ID>
  ```

- Add the `<KEY_GRIP>` and `password_vault` to setup function in `~/.config/yazi/init.lua`:

  ```lua
  require("gvfs"):setup({
    key_grip = "BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB",
    password_vault = "pass",
  })
  ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using `password_vault = "pass"` without `key_grip`, gvfs.yazi won't be able to save passwords to the password store.  
> GPG Keygrip IS NOT secret and does not need to be kept private.  
> So you can share your config file without worrying about leaking your passwords.

Now you can use gvfs.yazi and save passwords to the password store.  
To increase the time gpg-agent cache the passwords: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GnuPG#Cache_passwords

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to clear saved passwords, you can run these commands in terminal:

```bash
# Clear all saved passwords
pass rm -r gvfs -f
# Reset unlock state of GPG key
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
```

- Fix missing public key
  - If you copied `.gnupg` folder to another computer, you need to re-initialize the GPG key.

    ```bash
    echo <KEY_ID> > ~/.password-store/.gpg-id
    pass init <KEY_ID>
    ```

## Method 3. Use `passage` (Password Store) with `age` + YubiKey

Uses [passage](https://github.com/FiloSottile/passage) (a fork of `pass`) with [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) encryption instead of GPG. Optionally backed by a YubiKey via [age-plugin-yubikey](https://github.com/str4d/age-plugin-yubikey) for hardware-backed key storage.  
No GPG keyring, no keygrip, no gpg-agent required.

- Install `passage`:

  ```bash
  # Arch
  pacman -S passage

  # Or install from source
  # See https://github.com/FiloSottile/passage
  ```

- Set up passage with age (or age + YubiKey). Refer to [passage setup documentation](https://github.com/FiloSottile/passage) for details.

- Make sure `passage` works:

  ```bash
  passage ls
  ```

- Add `password_vault = "passage"` to setup function in `~/.config/yazi/init.lua`:

  ```lua
  require("gvfs"):setup({
    password_vault = "passage",
  })
  ```

  No `key_grip` is needed — passage handles encryption via age identities.

Now you can use gvfs.yazi and save passwords to the passage store.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to clear saved passwords, you can run these commands in terminal:

```bash
# Clear all saved passwords
passage rm -r gvfs -f
```
